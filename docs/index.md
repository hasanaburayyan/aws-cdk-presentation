# AWS Cloud Developer Kit Presentation

## Intro

Building and deploying cloud infrastructure can be a little over whelming, ensuring that the infrastructure can be automated to be reliably redeployed is an additional level of complexity. As Infrastructure as Code (IaC) becomes more popular we are seeing some pretty exciting advancements in this field, one in particular is Cloud Development Kits (CDK). Lets take a some time to talk about IaC and what CDK means in uniting developers with managing their infrastructure.
