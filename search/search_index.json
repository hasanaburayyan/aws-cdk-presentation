By day I work on the AWS application migration efforts of the North Star 21 initiative, by night I help teach students at Franklin University Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures. In my free time I enjoy to miserably fail at trying to convince my wife and 3 children they love computer science as much as I do. Some other hobbies include; archery, yoyos, and watching movies that are soo terrible they are wonderful!
